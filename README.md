## SeleniumBase Browser Automation (CI/CD)
- "SeleniumBase" is an automation framework built on top of Selenium WebDriver for Python. It provides additional functionalities and utilities to make web automation easier and more efficient. SeleniumBase provides an easy-to-use API that simplifies the process of writing and running Selenium tests.
- In this project i make some automation tests and running webdriver. For that i use "https://practice.automationbro.com/" for verify title of url, working with input fields, find multiple elements, POM (Page Object Model), handlind wait commands, Jenkis and Github integrations and more.

### How to Run the Tests
- Run each test case individually by executing the respective test files (python test_cart.py, python test_contact.py, etc.).
## Jenkis
### Install Jenkins:

- Download and install Jenkins on your server or local machine. You can find the installation instructions for different operating systems on the Jenkins website.
Configure Jenkins:

Access Jenkins through your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:8080 (or the URL where Jenkins is installed).
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Jenkins setup.
Install the required plugins like "GitHub Integration Plugin" (if using GitHub), "HTML Publisher Plugin," and "Pipeline Plugin" (for creating pipelines).
- Set up the SeleniumBase project in Jenkins:
-- Configure Test Reporting:
To generate test reports, use the "Publish HTML reports" post-build action in Jenkins. Specify the paths to the test reports generated by SeleniumBase, such as reports/*.html.
Optionally, you can also integrate your Jenkins job with a test management system like Allure for better test reporting.
Set Up Jenkins Triggers:

- Configure when the Jenkins job should trigger the test execution. It could be triggered manually, periodically, or after a Git commit (using hooks).

- Save the Jenkins job configuration and run the job. Jenkins will pull the latest code, set up the virtual environment, execute the test cases, and generate the test reports.
-- Monitor and Analyze Test Results:

- Monitor the Jenkins job execution and analyze the test results in the Jenkins web interface.
